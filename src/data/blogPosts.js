EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is the fixed amount you pay every month toward your loan.

EMI Formula:

EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N – 1]

Where:
P = Principal Loan Amount
R = Monthly Interest Rate
N = Number of Months

Understanding EMI helps you plan your finances effectively.
